Derats's Abolute Wacky Arcanists Pack v4
A pack only composed of mage and sorcerer whose particularity is to make you change your way of playing.

Scourge (Wizard)
Advantage:
- He remembers all his spells and regains his innate abilities each round.
Disadvantage:
- Can only learn spells from Evocation and Necromancy schools.
Note:
This kit also installs a new level 1 evocation spell (from my mod L'Interplan), necessary to be able to choose the 6 minimum spells when creating the character in BG2. (7 in TOB, but who creates a new character for TOB, seriously?)


Enraged (Wizard)
Advantages:
- Whenever he kills a creature he gain Improved Alacrity for one round.
- +15% damage dealt, weapon or spell.
Disadvantages:
- He gives no credit to defensives schools and does not learn any spells from the schools of Abjuration, Divination, and Illusion.
- When his hit points drop below 25% he becomes a Spell berserk.(For 5 rounds the Enraged can no longer move or attack. He can only think of casting spells: he gain Improved Alacrity and -2 to casting time but has a 15% chance of missing incantations.
Note :
The kit use the spell effect #232 "Spell Effect: Cast Spell on Condition", then spells using the same effect will not work on him (Fireshield, for exemple).
Playing with schools is not a simple exercise: because of this, some spells are "green" and you MUST choose at least one of them when creating your character. However, there is no problem with memorizing spells afterwards.

Psychotope (Wizard)
Advantage:
- Casting time fixed to 1.
- Every 3 rounds he rememorize a lost spell of the maximum known level. If there is no spell to rememorize at that level, it is one spell level below instead.
Disadvantage:
- Any loss of consciousness: sleep (from a night's rest or induced), stun, fear, berserk, charm, confusion, debility, or death causes him to forget all his spells.


Spell stealer (Wizard)
Advantage:
- Can at will, on contact, make an arcanist forget a spell (no saving throw) to remember himself a spell of maximum known level.
- Can once a day, on contact, make an arcanist forget all his spells (saving throw against death) to remember all his spells himself.
Disadvantage:
- Can memorize one less spell per spell level.
- Each access to a new spell level is slowed down by one level (first spell of level 1 at level 2 of wizard).


Eoratian (Sorcerer)
Advantage:
- He remembers all his spells and regains his innate abilities at the end of each fight.
Disadvantage:
- Can memorize three fewer spells per spell level.
- Each access to a new spell level is slowed down by one level (first spell level 1 at level 2 of spellcaster).
- Unaffected by effects that allow to memorize more spells.


Anomaly (Sorcerer)
Advantage:
- Immune to offensive magic and 100% magic resistance.
- Immune to poison, disease and level drain.
- Immune to dead magic, miscast and imposed wild surges.
- Gains one hit point each time he casts a spell (out of combat only if an automatic combat script is allocated to him)

Disadvantage:

- Conventional healing (spells, potions) do not affect it.
